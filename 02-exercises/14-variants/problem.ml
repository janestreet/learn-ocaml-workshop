(* As in most languages, you can define your own types. The keyword [type]
   introduces a type definition.

   One of the non-basic types in OCaml is called the variant type.  Variant
   types are similar to Enums in other languages. They are types which may take
   on multiple forms, where each form is marked by an explicit tag. A variant
   type is defined as follows: *)
type color =
  | Red
  | Green
  | Blue

(* Variants are very useful in combination with pattern matching. (Check out
   exercise 6 for a refresher on pattern matching.) *)
let to_string color =
  match color with
  | Red   -> "red"
  | Green -> "green"
  | Blue  -> "blue"

(* OCaml variants are in many ways more powerful than Enums because the
   different constructors of your variant can include data in them. Here's an
   example: *)
type card_value =
  | Ace
  | King
  | Queen
  | Jack
  | Number of int

let one_card_value : card_value = Queen
let another_card_value : card_value = Number 8

let card_value_to_string card_value =
  match card_value with
  | Ace      -> "Ace"
  | King     -> "King"
  | Queen    -> "Queen"
  | Jack     -> "Jack"
  | Number i -> Int.to_string i

(* Write a function that computes the score of a card (aces should score 11
   and face cards should score 10). *)
let card_value_to_score card_value =
  match card_value with
  | Ace -> 11
  | King
  | Queen
  | Jack -> 10
  | Number i -> i

(* Remember the list type? We can define a list as a variant type too! *)
type int_list = 
  | Empty 
  | Not_empty of int * int_list

(* OCaml actually allows us to define a list type that can contain any type of
   value, not just integers, by using parametrized types. *)
type 'a generic_list = 
  | Empty
  | Not_empty of 'a * 'a generic_list

(* Recall that ['a] is called a type parameter, for which any other type may be
   supplied. For example, we can use the [generic_list] type to define an
   integer list. *)
type another_int_list = int generic_list

let%test "Testing card_value_to_score..." =
  Int.(=) 11 (card_value_to_score Ace)

let%test "Testing card_value_to_score..." =
  Int.(=) 10 (card_value_to_score King)

let%test "Testing card_value_to_score..." =
  Int.(=) 10 (card_value_to_score Queen)

let%test "Testing card_value_to_score..." =
  Int.(=) 10 (card_value_to_score Jack)

let%test "Testing card_value_to_score..." =
  Int.(=) 5 (card_value_to_score (Number 5))
