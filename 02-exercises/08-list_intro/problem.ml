(*
   OCaml natively supports linked lists as part of the language.
   Lists are commonly referred to as having heads and tails.
   The head is the first element of the linked list
   The tail is everything else.

   To construct a list we use the cons infix operator :: to append elements to 
   the front of a list

   val (::) : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list

   [] means "the empty list".
   hd :: tl means "the element hd added to the front of the list tl".

   When matching on a list, it's either empty or non-empty. To say it another way, it's
   either equal to [] or equal to (hd :: tl) where hd is the first element of the list
   and tl is all the rest of the elements of the list (which may itself be empty).
*)

let () = assert ([%compare.equal: int list] [ 5; 1; 8; 4 ]  (5 :: 1 :: 8 :: 4  :: []))

(* This function computes the length of a list. *)
let rec length lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0
  | _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl
;;

(* Write a function to add up the elements of a list by matching on it. *)
let rec sum lst = failwith "For you to implement"

(* The signature for the append operator is
   val (@) : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

   It's an infix operator.
*)
let list_append first second = first @ second

(* The way you put something on the head to the list
   uses the same kind of syntax for matching on lists.
   val (::) : 'a -> 'a list -> 'a list
