(* Welcome to Jane Street's OCaml challenges!

   This exercise is just meant to familiarize you with the system.

   Write OCaml code using your favorite text editor; if you aren't already
   committed to one, we recommend Visual Studio Code.

   1. To compile your code and run inline tests, run

   $ dune runtest

   in a terminal session in this problem's directory.

   Try building this code.

   You should see a compilation error because it's missing the end quote. Add
   the end quote and re-run. You should see that the code compiled and ran! 

   2. OCaml has a toplevel interpreter (i.e. a REPL, or read-eval-print
   loop) called utop. Try starting up utop in the command line like so:

   $ utop

   You can also execute code in this environment directly. Try
   pasting the previous line of code into utop and running it there.

let () = Stdio.printf "Hello, World!
