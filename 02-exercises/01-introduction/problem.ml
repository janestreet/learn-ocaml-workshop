(* Welcome to Jane Street's OCaml challenges!

   This exercise is just meant to familiarize you with the system.

   Write OCaml code using your favorite text editor; if you aren't already
   committed to one, we recommend Visual Studio Code.

   To compile your code and run inline tests, run

   [dune runtest]

   in a terminal session in this problem's directory.

   Try building this code.

   You should see a compilation error because it's missing the end quote. Add
   the end quote and re-run. You should see that the code compiled and ran!

   You can also execute code in utop directly. Try pasting this line of code
   into utop and running it there. *)
let () = Stdio.printf "Hello, World!
