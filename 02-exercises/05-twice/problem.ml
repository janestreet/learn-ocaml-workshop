(* Write a function that adds 1 to an int. (This function may seem familiar!) *)
let add1 x = x + 1

(* Now write a function that squares its argument. *)
let square x = x * x

(* Functions are "first class" in OCaml. This means that you can take a function
   and pass it around as an argument to other functions. We call functions that
   take other functions as arguments "higher order functions".

   Let's write a function named [twice], which will take a function as its first
   argument, and apply that function two times to its second argument.

   Hint: Remember that you can use parenthese or let bindings to order function
   calls.  *)
let twice f x = f (f x)

(* Take a second to look at the function signature for [twice] in the mli
   file. Note that the first argument of twice is a function, [f], which has
   type [int -> int]. We had to wrap its type in parentheses when representing
   it in the function signature. *)

(* Now that we have [twice], try writing [add2] and [raise_to_the_fourth] using
   [add1] and [square]. *)
let add2 = twice add1
let raise_to_the_fourth = twice square

let%test "Testing add1..." =
  Int.(=) 5 (add1 4)

let%test "Testing square..." =
  Int.(=) 16 (square 4)

let%test "Testing square..." =
  Int.(=) 16 (square (-4))

let%test "Testing add1..." =
  Int.(=) 5 (twice add1 3)

let%test "Testing add2..." =
  Int.(=) 1337 (add2 1335)

let%test "Testing raise_to_the_fourth..." =
  Int.(=) 1 (raise_to_the_fourth 1)

let%test "Testing raise_to_the_fourth..." =
  Int.(=) 10000 (raise_to_the_fourth 10)
