(* Sometimes rather than redefining the record you would like to have a field or
   a set of fields that you can modify on the fly.

   In OCaml if you want to have a field in a record that can be updated in place
   you must use some additional syntax. The mutable keyword makes the field
   modifiable.

   Then you can use <- to set the record value to a new value. *)

(* You'll get an error about Unbound value compare_color. This is because we
   used the [compare] ppx for [stoplight] below, which has a [color] as one of
   its fields, but we didn't have [compare] on [color].

   Fix it by adding this: [@@deriving compare]
*)

  { location : string (* stoplights don't usually move *)

(* Now rather than using a functional update we can use a mutable update.
   This doesn't return a new stoplight, it modifies the input stoplight.
*)
let set_color stoplight color = stoplight.color <- color

(* Since we know that stoplights always go from Green to Yellow, Yellow to
   Red, and Red to Green, we can just write a function to advance the color
   of the light without taking an input color. *)
