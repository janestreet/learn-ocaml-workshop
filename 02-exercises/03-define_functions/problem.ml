(* Recall from exercise 2 that we use [let] to define functions.

   Definitions take on the form:

   {| let FUNCTION_NAME ARG1 ARG2 ... = BODY |} 

   For example, here we define a function [add1] that takes a single int
   argument and returns that argument plus 1. *)
let add1 arg = arg + 1

(* [string_append] uses the built-in [( ^ )] operator to concatenate two
   strings. *)
let string_append x y = x ^ y

(* We can annotate a function definition with types as well. *)
let add1_float (arg : float) : float = arg +. 1.

(* In OCaml, outside of strings, whitespace and newlines are the same.

   So, you could also write

   {| 
       let  FUNCTION_NAME
       ARG1
       ARG2
       =
       BODY
   |}

   and it's the same to the compiler. *)

(* Let's define a few more functions below. Remember that you can see the
   function signatures in the mli file. *)

let plus x y =
   x + y
let times x y = 
   x * y
let minus x y = 
   x - y
let divide x y = 
   x / y

let%test "Testing plus..." = Int.( = ) 2 (plus 1 1)
let%test "Testing plus..." = Int.( = ) 49 (plus (-1) 50)
let%test "Testing times..." = Int.( = ) 64 (times 8 8)
let%test "Testing times..." = Int.( = ) (-2048) (times (-2) 1024)
let%test "Testing minus..." = Int.( = ) (-4) (minus (-2) 2)
let%test "Testing minus..." = Int.( = ) 1000 (minus 1337 337)
let%test "Testing divide..." = Int.( = ) 512 (divide 1024 2)
let%test "Testing divide..." = Int.( = ) 1010 (divide 31337 31)
